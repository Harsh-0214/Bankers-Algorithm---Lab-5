## Description
This algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible activities, ensuring that the system can allow all processes to finish their tasks without entering a deadlock state
